                    <h1>What is a Bezier curve?</h1>

                    <p>Curves, in the binary world of pixels and bytes such a thing can in fact exist. Just like in the real world where the curve of the wheel helps it roll smoothly, and the curve of the arch gives it strength curves in the digital realm occupy many roles from functional to aesthetic. The Bezier curve like many tools used in graphic design has its roots in complicated mathematical formulas that dictate precisely how the curve functions. For the most part we will be ignoring that math and instead focus on a few key components that make up the Bezier curve. Fundamentally a Bezier curve is a set of points that are connected to each other, each point that makes up the curve can have points that let you further control the shape and complexity of a curve. 
                    
                    Bezier Curves can be made up of end points and control points, end points are where each point of the curve connects and passes through, control points control the shape of the curve between end points. </p>

                    <p>Curves in 2D are simple: You click, you drag. Thatâ€™s it click the control points and drag the control points, the curve will update to show you the changes you are. In 3D its relatively the same click and drag, but now in 3D! Not all Bezier curves are equal though. The simplest is the linear Bezier Curve and ironically enough has no curves at all as it has no control points to help bend the curve. Next in the line comes quadratic Bezier curves, these lovely curves sport a single control point shared between end points. And finally </p>
